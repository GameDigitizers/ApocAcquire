ApocAcquire [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/GameDigitizers/ApocAcquire.png)](https://travis-ci.org/GameDigitizers/ApocAcquire)

===========

Need to discuss:
--------------
1. Adding player to action constructor or some other way to know which player did what action.
2. Should we add an action for assigning a chain to a set of played tiles? Or maybe just save the chain objects to db?
